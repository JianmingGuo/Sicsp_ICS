<p>Each .png file includes a transparent layer to 
allow for easy cutting and pasting into new images, and is made up of multiple 
sizes for each element. The way to preview these compound images is to use 
Windows Explorer and set the View to &quot;Thumbnails&quot;.</p>

<p><b>Use Restrictions<br>
</b>These common elements are to be used in the development and illustration of 
new custom imagery.&nbsp; As part of a visual language, these images (or any 
part of the images) must be used in a manner consistent with the name of the 
file, which is self-descriptive of the annotation that the imagery represents.</p>
