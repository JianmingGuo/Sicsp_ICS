While the layout and function is similar to the 3.1 interface, the vast majority of the interface had to be rebuilt using JavaFX.  Many minor changes are unavoidable, but this brought increased stability.  These notes should detail the majority of the changes, but do not detail everything.",

The session state is a ZIP containing multiple XML files which contains all the data and the UI state information (It includes all the data generated from reading the imported files, but not hte actual file contents;  a test case of 5.4GB of PCAP yields an approximately 300MB file).  This state can be restored by loading the session.  Starting a new Session will restore many values to defaults, whereas clear Topology will simply un-import files.",
